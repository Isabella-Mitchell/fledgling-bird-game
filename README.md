# Fledgling Website 

## Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Front-End Site 

* Fledgling is an interactive website with the purpose of engaging people in birdwatching. It features a bird identification game, and it allows the user to generate lists of recent viewings local to an address they provide. The website has a clean, responsive design and playful illustrations, which make it visually appealing and functional on any device. 

* This is my Milestone Project 2 submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. My website features three pages and is built using technologies that I have learnt including HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
